# TSPHeuristics

This repository contains my first experiment in writing a Julia package. Shortly it should be a simple package containing heuristic methods for the Traveling Salesman Problem. 

If you are not me, it is remarkable that you've found this repository at all. Apologies for the mess, have a cookie, and please enjoy your stay.
